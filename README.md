The Horse Feeding Management System is a project I made for one of my classes, inspired by my experience living on a farm and caring for horses. It helps manage feeding schedules, track hay inventory, and organize supplier information using a SQL database. The system includes:

Feeding Records: Logs feeding events by date, horse, and hay used.
Hay Bales: Manages hay inventory, quality, and supplier details.
Horses: Stores information about each horse, such as name and breed.
Suppliers: Keeps track of hay suppliers and their contact information.
