 Horse Feeding Management

This project is designed to manage and track the feeding and care of horses on a farm. It includes SQL queries to manage and analyze data related to the horses, hay bales, and feeding records.

 Files

 SQL Queries

All SQL queries are stored in the `/queries/` directory. Each file is named to clearly reflect its purpose. For example:

- **`retrieve_hay_bales_received_before_2023_01_05.sql`**: Retrieves hay bales received before January 5, 2023.
- **`list_horses_and_breeds.sql`**: Lists all horses along with their respective breeds.

 Query Results

Query results (if included) are stored in the `/query_results/` directory. These text files contain the output from running the SQL queries.

 How to Use

1. Navigate to the `queries/` directory to find the SQL queries.
2. Run the SQL files in your preferred SQL environment.
3. View the results in the `query_results/` directory if provided.
