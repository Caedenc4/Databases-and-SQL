# Horse Feeding Management System

The Horse Feeding Management System is a project I created for one of my classes, inspired by my experience living on a farm and caring for horses. This system helps manage feeding schedules, track hay inventory, and organize supplier information using a SQL database.

## Features
- **Feeding Records**: Logs feeding events by date, horse, and hay used.
- **Hay Bales**: Manages hay inventory, quality, and supplier details.
- **Horses**: Stores information about each horse, such as name and breed.
- **Suppliers**: Keeps track of hay suppliers and their contact information.
